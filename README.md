# Paletteify

A web app built with React, create-react-app, and the Spotify API that pulls colors from album covers to analyze the color palette of an artist or Spotify playlist. Log in with your Spotify account to look at your own playlists and top artists, or use the search bar to look some up. Check it out at https://jtarinelli.github.io/paletteify.
